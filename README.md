# Gradient_descend
In this project, we utilize a neural network model to predict whether a person is likely to purchase insurance based on certain features such as age, income, and location. The model is trained using the gradient descent optimization algorithm to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss function.

Key Components:
Neural Network Model: Implemented using Keras, consisting of a single dense layer with a sigmoid activation function.
Gradient Descent Optimization: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer, a variant of stochastic gradient descent.
Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing steps are included to prepare the input data for training the neural network.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric to measure the performance of the model.
Usage:
Data Preparation: Ensure your dataset is properly formatted with features and labels.
Model Training: Execute the training script to train the neural network model using gradient descent optimization.
Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using accuracy metrics on a separate validation dataset.
Prediction: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on new data points to determine the likelihood of insurance purchase.
